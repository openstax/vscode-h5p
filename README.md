# VScode H5P extension

A VSCode extension to play, create, edit and download H5P content inside your
Visual Studio Code IDE (Integrated Development Environment). This project is a
development effort to integrate H5P manipulation into Poet, a library developed
by Openstax.

`The project is still in its early stages and is not yet ready for production use.`

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openstax/vscode-h5p
cd vscode-h5p
npm install
./scripts/build.sh

```

## Run the extension in a new VSCode

In the VSCode editor, open the debug panel and select `Launch Extension`. This
will open a new VSCode window with the extension running. Clinking on a
`H5P zipped file` in the workspace will open the H5P manager.

## Features

- Download H5P content from the H5P Hub
- Create H5P content using preinstalled H5P libraries
- Edit H5P content
- Download the H5P content as a zip file
- Extract and display the H5P content in the editor

## Requirements

- VSCode
- NodeJS

## TODO

- [ ] On save, zip the content and save it to the workspace or specified
      location
- [ ] Add command to open the manager
- [ ] Contextual menu option for h5p files
- [ ] Extension settings
- [ ] Bundle extension to vsix
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] CI/CD
